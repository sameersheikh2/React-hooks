Update the project structure as

	src
	|- app.js
	|- route-page
	|- abramov_react_today_and_tomorrow
	|- ryan_florence_90_percent_cleaner_react_with_hooks
	|- michael_jackson_ryan_florence_fun_with_react_hooks
	|- ben_awad_react_hooks_tutorial

Use react-router for creating route-page, which links to all the below folder structures.
Each exercise could have index.js, which exposes the other components of the exercise.
